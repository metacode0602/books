title: Function calling using Ollama models

Here is a quick breakthrough of using functions with Mixtral running on Ollama
[Code](https://github.com/namuan/llm-playground/blob/main/local-llm-tools-simple.py) is available here.
It is built on top of [openhermes-functions](https://github.com/abacaj/openhermes-function-calling/blob/main/openhermes-functions.ipynb) by abacaj üôè
```y
```

The prompt used looks like this
```
You have access to the following tools:
{function_to_json(get_weather)}
{function_to_json(calculate_mortgage_payment)}
{function_to_json(get_directions)}
{function_to_json(get_article_details)}

You must follow these instructions:
Always select one or more of the above tools based on the user query
If a tool is found, you must respond in the JSON format matching the following schema:
{{
   "tools": {{
        "tool": "<name of the selected tool>",
        "tool_input": <parameters for the selected tool, matching the tool's JSON schema
   }}
}}
If there are multiple tools required, make sure a list of tools are returned in a JSON array.
If there is no tool that match the user request, you will respond with empty json.
Do not add any additional Notes or Explanations

User Query:

And ran it through the following functions

‚ùìWhat‚Äôs the weather in London, UK
‚ùìDetermine the monthly mortgage payment for a loan amount of $200,000, an interest rate of 4%, and a loan term of 30 years
‚ùìWhat‚Äôs the current exchange rate for GBP to EUR
‚ùìI‚Äôm planning a trip to Killington, Vermont (05751) from Hoboken, NJ (07030). Can you get me weather for both locations and directions
```
‚ùìWhat's the weather in London, UK?
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "tool": "get_weather",
      "tool_input": {
        "city": "London, UK"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```
‚ùìDetermine the monthly mortgage payment for a loan amount of $200,000, an interest rate of 4%, and a loan term of 30 years.
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "tool": "calculate_mortgage_payment",
      "tool_input": {
        "loan_amount": 200000,
        "interest_rate": 4.0,
        "loan_term": 30
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
The following case is where the function isn‚Äôt available therefore no tools in the response.
```
‚ùìWhat's the current exchange rate for GBP to EUR?
{
  "tools": []
}
```
And the following requires multiple function calls. Very impressed to see it returning the correct functions in the sequence
```
‚ùìI'm planning a trip to Killington, Vermont (05751) from Hoboken, NJ (07030). Can you get me weather for both locations and directions?
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "tool": "get_weather",
      "tool_input": {
        "city": "Killington, Vermont"
      }
    },
    {
      "tool": "get_weather",
      "tool_input": {
        "city": "Hoboken, NJ"
      }
    },
    {
      "tool": "get_directions",
      "tool_input": {
        "start": "Hoboken, NJ 07030",
        "destination": "Killington, Vermont 05751"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
